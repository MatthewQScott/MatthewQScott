# Matthew Scott's Repositories
I am a recent computer science graduate with knowledge of Android development, machine learning, and information security. Some of the projects I've worked on:

- An Android app to convert measurements from one unit to another. ([respository](https://github.com/calvinlee326/Converter))
- Concentration, a memorization card game in which the player flips only two cards at once as they try to find matching pairs ([respository](https://github.com/MatthewQScott/Concentration))
- An encrypted chatroom application written in Python that uses secure key sharing to establish a secure connection between chatroom participants and the server. ([repository](https://github.com/AndrewG76/3800-Project-1))
